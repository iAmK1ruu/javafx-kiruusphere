## To-be-implemented:

* When the user searches, the concurring elements become invisible, and the search bar expands (the search button becomes 2-way purpose)
* Uses real-time weather API to track various weather conditions, future predictions, air quality (optional).
* [Optional] Users will be able to save their favorite location, and will be shown by default when the application starts (implement using Absolute Layout)
